## Computer Vision

- Computer Vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to extract useful information from visual inputs such as photographs and videos.
- It seeks to automate human visual activity by understanding it.
- Object detection and video tracking are two examples of computer vision applications.

## History of Computer Vision
- The field of computer vision began in the 1960s with the goal of better understanding human visual behavior.
- Through a series of tests, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel made a significant contribution to our understanding of the human visual system.
- The Cat Experiment, which they did in 1959, is one of their most well-known experiments. This experiment was a watershed moment in the study of the role of neuron arrangement in visual perception in the human brain.
- Seymour Papert began "The Summer Vision Project," a well-known MIT project, in 1966.
- The project's main purpose was to create a system of programs that could partition a picture into sections like likely objects, likely background areas, and so on.
- In 1970, David Mar wrote influential book Computer Vision. Concept - every object pieced together in terms of geometrical cylinders or pictorial structures.

- One of the most influential dataset is known as "PASCAL Visual Object Challenge."

- PASCAL Visual Object Challenge is a dataset consisting of 20 object categories.
- Around 1999 AD to 2000 AD, statistical machine learning techniques started to gain momentum/
- In 2009, ImageNet was started, ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge benchmark in object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories and millions of images.
