## Backpropagation Algorithm

- Backpropagation algorithm is probably the most fundamental building block in a neural network.
- The algorithm is used to effectively train a neural network through a method called chain rule. In simple terms, after each forward pass through a network, backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the modelâ€™s parameters (weights and biases).
